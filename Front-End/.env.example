# Front-end environment examples
# When running Next dev locally and you want the front-end to call the backend directly,
# set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL to the backend host reachable from your machine.
# For example (local backend):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# When running the full docker-compose stack with nginx proxying /api -> backend,
# you can leave this unset (the client will use /api and nginx will proxy requests).

# Example for remote host:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://26.13.31.18:8080
